          Sam Walton was born in 1918 in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. In 1942, at the age of 24,
          he joined the military. He married Helen Robson in 1943. When his military service
          ended in 1945, Sam and Helen moved to Iowa and then to Newport, Arkansas. During
          this time, Sam gained early retail experience, eventually operating his own variety
          store.In 1950, the Waltons left Newport for Bentonville, where Sam opened Walton’s
          5&10 on the downtown square. They chose Bentonville because Helen wanted small-town
          living, and Sam could take advantage of the different hunting seasons that living
          at the corner of four states had to offer.Inspired by the early success of his dime
          store, and driven to bring even greater opportunity and value to his customers,
          Sam opened the first Walmart in 1962 at the age of 44 in Rogers, Arkansas.It was
          during Sam's acceptance remarks that he articulated what would come to be Walmart's
          official company purpose.</p>

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
